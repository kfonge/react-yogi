# Challenges
The greatest challenges was debugging between different versions of react-router-dom 5 and 6. Learning to style using react bootstrap and cards for the first time. I also struggled with deploying the app to netlify.

# Future Developments
- Including a link to video of the pose on youtube
- using more human like images OR adding animation to the silhouettes for more interactive experience
- using another api to find descriptions of the poses and the beneifts they offer
- Building out the UX flow to increase user friendliness and specificity
